# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive cat feeder mobile application that communicates with a Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 development board via WiFi connection. The app features four main screens accessible through bottom navigation: Camera (실시간 카메라), Manual (수동 급식), Schedule (급식 스케줄), and Log (급식 기록). The ESP32S3 board controls the physical cat feeder mechanism including camera and motor operations. The app provides pet owners with complete control over their cat's feeding schedule and monitoring capabilities, similar to iPhone's native alarm app design patterns for the schedule functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want to navigate between different app sections using bottom navigation, so that I can quickly access camera, manual feeding, scheduling, and feeding logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL display a bottom navigation bar with four tabs: Camera, Manual, Schedule, and Log
2. WHEN a user taps any navigation tab THEN the system SHALL switch to the corresponding screen immediately
3. WHEN a user is on any screen THEN the system SHALL highlight the active tab in the bottom navigation
4. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL default to the Camera screen as the initial view

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want to view a live camera feed of my cat feeder, so that I can monitor my pet's feeding behavior in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the Camera screen THEN the system SHALL display a live video feed from the ESP32S3 connected camera
2. WHEN the camera feed is loading THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
3. IF the WiFi connection to ESP32S3 fails THEN the system SHALL display connection status and retry options
4. WHEN the camera feed is active THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive controls for camera interaction
5. WHEN the ESP32S3 board is offline THEN the system SHALL show device connection status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want to manually trigger feeding, so that I can feed my cat on-demand outside of scheduled times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the Manual screen THEN the system SHALL display feeding control options
2. WHEN a user triggers manual feeding THEN the system SHALL send a WiFi command to the ESP32S3 board to activate the motor
3. WHEN manual feeding is initiated THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback of the motor operation status
4. WHEN manual feeding completes THEN the system SHALL log the feeding event with timestamp
5. IF the ESP32S3 board is not connected via WiFi THEN the system SHALL display connection status and troubleshooting options
6. WHEN the motor operation fails THEN the system SHALL receive error feedback from ESP32S3 and display appropriate messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want to create and manage feeding schedules, so that my cat is fed automatically at consistent times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the Schedule screen THEN the system SHALL display a list of configured feeding schedules similar to iPhone's alarm app interface
2. WHEN a user wants to add a new schedule THEN the system SHALL provide a time picker and feeding amount selector
3. WHEN a user creates a schedule THEN the system SHALL allow setting repeat patterns (daily, specific days, one-time)
4. WHEN a user edits an existing schedule THEN the system SHALL allow modification of time, amount, and repeat settings
5. WHEN a user toggles a schedule on/off THEN the system SHALL immediately update the schedule status
6. WHEN a scheduled feeding time arrives THEN the system SHALL send WiFi commands to the ESP32S3 board to automatically trigger the motor feeding process
7. WHEN schedules are displayed THEN the system SHALL show next feeding time prominently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want to view feeding history and logs, so that I can track my cat's eating patterns and ensure proper nutrition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the Log screen THEN the system SHALL display a chronological list of all feeding events
2. WHEN feeding logs are displayed THEN the system SHALL show timestamp, feeding amount, and feeding type (manual/scheduled)
3. WHEN a user views feeding logs THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options by date range
4. WHEN feeding data is available THEN the system SHALL display daily/weekly feeding summaries
5. WHEN no feeding data exists THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate empty state message
6. WHEN feeding logs are extensive THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or infinite scroll for performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want the app to have intuitive and responsive design, so that I can easily use all features without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any screen THEN the system SHALL provide consistent UI patterns and visual hierarchy
2. WHEN interacting with any control THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN the app is used on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain usability and readability
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages
5. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states to indicate progress
